Organization Overview:
Sweet Candy is the name of the fictional organization/small business.
The small business of Sweet Candy started in 2020 during Covid-19 in someone’s home where they had an idea to sell sweets to people who could not go to shops to buy snacks as they were in quarantine. With their growing clientele they are looking to expand and start selling online.
The mission of Sweet Candy is to provide people with delicious snacks all over the country for enjoyment and convenience. The vision is to be the number 1 snack provider in the country.
The target audience for this organization is all kinds of people who like sweets whether in small or large quantity, for lunchboxes, parties or guilty pleasures. All these people will be provided for and satisfied.
Website Goals and Objectives:
The goals for the website are to increase the volume of products sold to customers and provide buying convenience to customers nationally.
The key performance indicators (KPI) that will measure the success of the website and organization are as follows:
- website visits: the more people who use the website the more successful it is.
- orders placed: how many orders are placed on the website will indicate success.
- sales conversion: how many customers visit the site and actually buy the product can indicate success.
- customer retention: the number of customers who return to make more purchases.
- cart abandonment: the number of customers who will visit the website and not make any purchases. (cascade.app, 2025).
Proposed Website Features and Functionality:
The website will include features such as a homepage where a customer will land first and see promotions, sales and new products and recommended ones. An about us page will be available to state the mission of the organization. A contact page will be present and include places where you can contact the business such as social media handles of Instagram, twitter and Facebook and phone number to call for service. 
The website will also include a footer for easier navigation through the bottom of the page. The website will also feature a shopping cart page which will help customers see the products they want to buy and provide easier payments and checkouts. 
The website functionalities will include easy navigation throughout the whole website. It will also be very responsive to commands to better suit every kind of device like desktops and phones. Fast loading pages will provide good user experience and satisfaction. High quality images of products will be featured throughout the website to entice customers.(searchenginejournal.com, 2024), (outerboxdesign.com, 2025).
Design and User Experience:
The overall layout, design and aesthetic of the business website will have a color scheme of red and pink to symbolize sweet things such as sweets and snacks. The website will also have high quality images of the products that will entice customers into buying the products. It will have a whimsical and fantastical typography symbolizing the feeling of sweet things. It will also include background images of the products on every page. 
The user experience of customers will be accounted for as the website will be easy to use, have high loading speeds, the website will be optimized for every type of device to satisfy customers, and will be aesthetically pleasing for the shopping customers. The layout will be simple and easy to navigate. (bigcommerce.com, 2025).
Technical Requirements:
The programming languages that will be used to develop the website are HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, etc.
Timeline and Milestones:
The timeline of the project is expected to run through 3 months, which all have key milestones. The first month will be all about planning the project, researching and working with programming languages like html and building the website from scratch and establishing the foundation and designing the framework and all other essential website elements like headers, footers, navigation and main content. 
And then the second month will be about CSS, which is all about styling, which includes website layout, typography and color schemes. User experience will also be prioritized by designing a responsive website which satisfies customers.
The last month will be about polishing the website to make sure it meets standards and is successfully launched. This will be done using JavaScript to add things like animations and interactive forms to complete the website.

Budget:
For a website like this for a small business in the country of South Africa like Sweet Candy it will cost no more than R15 000 as it does not need many complicated features and doesn't need many people to develop one website. But the features it will need like high optimization, easy navigation, shopping cart system and content such as high quality and videos, including them in 5 web pages and depending on the programming language used it will cost around R6000-R15000.
